# MVP_Retrofit
Android MVP implementation with Retrofit.

There was a time when me and my team wondering how to do MVP.
By next week, yeah we got it.

But wait.. we realized that we use firebase and custom retrofit. We got to refactor those classes.
By next week, yes we got it.

Hope you guys who somehow end up here, might save their (at least) a week of their time and have a good sprint.

Good luck
