# MVP_Retrofit
Android MVP implementation with Retrofit.

There was a time when me and my team wondering how to do MVP.
By next week, yes we got it.
But.. we had custom retrofit class, what to do?
By next week, yes we got it.

Hope you guys who somehow end up here, might save their (at least) week ahead.
Good luck, good code
